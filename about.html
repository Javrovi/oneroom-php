    <p>
      OneRoom is a simple grade tracking web application that I wrote for my programming
      portfolio in summer 2011.  This version of OneRoom is written using the
      <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>
      web application framework.  There are two other versions of OneRoom in my
      portfolio: one written with the
      <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> framework, and another one written
      with the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a> (PHP and MySQL).
      I coded OneRoom as a simple (but useful) web
      app that I can try out different frameworks with for comparison and contrast.  In
      the future I may write more versions of OneRoom (e.g., Groovy and
      <a href="http://www.grails.org">Grails</a>?).

    <h3>What does OneRoom do?</h3>
    <p>
      OneRoom is an application that allows teachers and students to track grades. Teachers can
      input grades for assignments and students can view their grades.  For more details, go to
      the <a href="/oneroom/gradetracker/help/">Help</a> page.
      
      OneRoom uses the MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern.  There is a little bit of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a> in OneRoom - the search
      function is a live search.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What languages/frameworks/standards are used in OneRoom?</h3>
    <p>
      In this version of OneRoom, I used the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>
      web application framework (version 1.3), which is written in the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
      language. For the AJAX live search feature, I used the <a href="www.jquery.com">jQuery</a>
      Javascript library.
      In addition, I also used
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a> for formatting
      the (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a>) web pages.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What resources did you use in coding and designing OneRoom?</h3>
    <p>
      The online documentation for Django and jQuery are both excellent. In addition,
